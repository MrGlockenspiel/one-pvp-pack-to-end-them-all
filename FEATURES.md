## "Features" of the pack

- [ ] RGB slimes
- [ ] "Transparent" inventory but its actually just the transparency checkerboard pattern

- [X] Purposefully ugly ore borders and ore emmisives
- [ ] Never Gonna Give You Up may randomly play
- [X] Really high resolution but shitty looking armor
- [X] Diamond armor needs to be red, obviously (Like, FULL red) (As in RGB 255, 0, 0) (Or hex #FF0000)
- [ ] Random resolutions for every texture ranging from 12-30x (from 30x and on, we reach the point of dimishing pain, can't have that)
- [ ] More cubes per cube model
- [ ] Short swords but the held model is moved to block your vision even more than vanilla
- [ ] Tilt the screen by 5 degrees for absolutely no reason (unfortunately will only work on fabulous graphics)
- [ ] Mixels becasue yes
- [ ] "Optimized" models for lanterns/torches/stuff (I sure do love 3 cube lanterns)

- [ ] Must be for 1.8 (and 1.16, I really, really want to make that fabulous shader)
- [ ] Gradients everywhere
